I can link to useful things like [google](https://www.google.com/) and [p8105](https://www.p8105.com/).


I can make an extra page on my site and link to that. Here's my [about](about.html), only need to write the name.html because they are inside the same repository.


## Here's Mr.Plankton

My cat's name is Mr.Plankton. Say hi.
