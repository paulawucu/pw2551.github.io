```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
```
```{r}
data(nyc_airbnb)

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) %>%
  select(
    neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price, room_type, lat, long) %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(rating),

## make a scatterplot

Here's a plotly scatterplot!

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>%
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nRating: ", rating)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    color = ~price, alpha = 0.5, text = ~text_label
  )
```

## Plotly boxplot

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(
    neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)
  ) %>% 
  plot_ly(y = ~price, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "box")   # click once to isolate out one boxplot
```

Here comes a bar chart
```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  count(neighbourhood) %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~n, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "bar", colors = "viridis")
```
